## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my knowledge of CSS Grid and how to create responsive layouts using media queries. I also got more comfortable working with custom properties and box shadows.

```css
.card:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: var(--purple-500);
  color: var(--purple-50);
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to continue practicing complex grid layouts and accessibility best practices for better user experiences.
